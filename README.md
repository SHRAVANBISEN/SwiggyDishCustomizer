## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights

### Advanced UI/UX Implementations

#### üé® **Dynamic Theming System**
- **Real-time Color Adaptation**: Background gradients that morph based on spice levels, sweetness, and saltiness
- **Contextual Visual Feedback**: UI elements change color intensity based on customization values
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur effects
- **Shadow Dynamics**: Elevation and glow effects that respond to user interactions

#### üé≠ **Animation Architecture**
```kotlin
// Multi-layered Animation System
@Composable
fun CustomizationSlider() {
    // 1. Spring Physics for Natural Movement
    val animatedValue by animateFloatAsState(
        animationSpec = spring(
            dampingRatio = Spring.DampingRatioMediumBouncy,
            stiffness = Spring.StiffnessMedium
        )
    )
    
    // 2. Infinite Transitions for Continuous Effects
    val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition()
    val pulseScale by infiniteTransition.animateFloat(
        initialValue = 1f,
        targetValue = 1.02f,
        animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable(
            animation = tween(1000),
            repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse
        )
    )
    
    // 3. State-Based Visual Transformations
    val glowIntensity by animateFloatAsState(
        targetValue = currentValue / maxValue
    )
}
```

#### üéõÔ∏è **Custom Slider Implementation**
- **Multi-Parameter Control**: Individual sliders for spice, portion, sweetness, saltiness
- **Visual Value Mapping**: Animated emojis (üå∂Ô∏è, üçØ, üßÇ, üçΩÔ∏è) that scale and fade based on values
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Labels that change dynamically ("Mild" ‚Üí "Hot" ‚Üí "Extra Hot")
- **Tactile Feedback**: Bounce animations and scaling effects on interaction

#### üé™ **Interactive Elements**
- **Pulsing Buttons**: Add-to-cart button with breathing animation
- **Morphing States**: Smooth transitions between "Add to Cart" and "Added" states
